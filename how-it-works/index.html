  	<p>From donated fur coats turned into Cuddle Coats - here's step by step how it works!</p>
	<ol>
	<li class="color2">Donations</li>
	<p><!--div class="main-image"><img src="/img/donated-coat.jpg"></div-->The first step in our process is fur coat donations from you! We get donations from all over the United States, check out the interactive map of all the places we have received donations. If you are interested in donating your fur coat more information can be found on our <a href="/donate">Donate</a> page.</p>
	<li class="color3">Prepping</li>
	<p>Our Volunteers meet every week and bi-monthly for prep sessions. Duing these sessions we remove the linings, buttons and other obtructive materials from the furs. Based on our partner needs we can provide large pieces of fur or small strips.</p>
	<li class="color4">Shipping</li>
	<p>Once the furs are prepped and ready to go to one of our partners we pack up the boxes. We've shipped over 800 furs to our partners! The cost of shipping furs can be expensive due to the weight of the furs, so we are always in need of donations to cover the costs.</p>
