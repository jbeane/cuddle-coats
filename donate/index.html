<div class="header1">Donate And Help An Orphaned Animal</div>

<div class="header2">Who Can Donate</div>

<p>The short answer here is anyone who wants to. Individuals who no longer want their furs or who have inherited unwanted furs may use their furs to help orphaned and injured wildlife. We will also accept donations from retailers.</p>

<p>Please note: we can only accept real fur items.</p>

<div class="header3">How to Donate</div>

<p>If you are in the Twin Cities area, you can drop off furs at our office, located at:</p>

<p class="address">Animal Rights Coalition<br>
317 West 48th Street<br>
Minneapolis, MN 55419</p>

<p>You may also take your furs to any of our <a href="/affiliates.html"> affiliate's locations</a> and drop them off there. Be sure to tell them that your furs are for the Cuddle Coats Program.</p>

<p>Please consider making a $5 or $10 donation with your fur donation. This helps with the shipping of the furs.</p>
	
<p>Please refrain from sending any fur pieces that have been treated with mothballs. </p>

<p>Regardless of your location, you can mail in your fur items to the address above.</p>

<p><strong>Be sure</strong> to include your mailing address on a slip of paper so that we can send you a tax receipt. If you're coming right to our office, we can fill one out for you there.</p>

<p>If you want to itemize deductions, you may claim the fair market value of your donation. This means you can deduct the amount for which you could sell the fur today, not the original purchase price. This estimation is your responsibility and you need to consider the type of fur as well as its condition. If you claim the value of the fur at $5,000 or more, the IRS will require a Qualified Appraisal. You must have this appraisal performed before you donate the fur. It is prudent to make copies of the letter we send you acknowledging your donation and include one with your tax returns. If you have any questions, we recommend you consult a tax attorney.</p>

<p>If you don't have a fur to donate, you can still support our work to help animals by <a href="http://www.animalrightscoalition.com" target="blank"> becoming a member of the Animal Rights Coalition</a>, our non-profit animal advocacy group.</p>
